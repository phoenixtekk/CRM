# Global Requirements — Assessments (category-level)

These requirements apply to every solution in the Assessments category (Security Optimization
Assessments, remediation playbooks, and cross-cutting security assessments). Published once at the
category level so listings stay small. Confirm these before running any assessment. Each entry:
Description / Why / Verify / Implement-if-missing.

> An assessment observes and scores; it does not change your tenant. Every assessment script here is
> **read-only** (the paired remediation work is separate and pilot-first). Scope, risk-acceptance, and
> remediation-priority decisions belong to the customer's security/compliance owners — the assessment
> supplies the evidence, not the authorization.

## G1. The workload/tenant being assessed
Description: An active Microsoft 365 / Entra tenant and/or Azure subscription(s) hosting the products in scope.
Why: There is nothing to assess without the target environment.
Verify: Sign in to the relevant portal(s) (`security.microsoft.com`, `portal.azure.com`) as an administrator.
Implement: Ensure the target tenant/subscription exists and the products under assessment are deployed (even partially — assessing coverage gaps is the point).

## G2. Read-only assessor access (least privilege)
Description: A read-only role sufficient to enumerate configuration — e.g. Security Reader, Global Reader, and/or Reader at the Azure scope.
Why: An assessment must never require write access; read-only proves it changes nothing.
Verify: Entra -> `Roles and administrators`; confirm Security Reader / Global Reader (and Azure Reader where cloud resources are assessed).
Implement: Assign the read-only roles; do not grant write/admin roles for the assessment itself.

## G3. Microsoft Graph / Az / management API access
Description: Microsoft Graph (Security), Azure Resource Manager, and product-specific management APIs reachable with the assessor identity.
Why: The assessment scripts collect configuration and posture via these APIs.
Verify: `Connect-MgGraph` (read scopes) and `Connect-AzAccount` succeed; the assessment discovery script runs. *Verify current API/permission scopes.*
Implement: Consent the read-only Graph scopes; ensure network access to the Microsoft endpoints.

## G4. Licensing for the products in scope
Description: The licenses/plans for the products being assessed (e.g. Defender for Endpoint/Identity/Office 365/Cloud Apps plans, Defender for Cloud plans).
Why: Some posture/configuration is only present (and only assessable) when the plan is enabled; the assessment flags plan gaps too.
Verify: Confirm the relevant plans in the admin/billing portal. *Verify current plan/feature mapping.*
Implement: Note unlicensed products as findings (a coverage gap) rather than skipping them silently.

## G5. Scope definition and a point-in-time baseline
Description: A defined assessment scope (which products, subscriptions, and users) and the understanding that results are a point-in-time snapshot.
Why: Scope keeps the assessment bounded and the score comparable; posture drifts, so results are dated.
Verify: The scope is documented; the assessment records the run date.
Implement: Agree the scope before running; re-run periodically to trend the score.

## G6. Best-practice reference baseline
Description: The best-practice / benchmark the assessment scores against (Microsoft security baselines, Secure Score, CIS/Zero-Trust as applicable).
Why: A score is only meaningful against a reference; the assessment states which baseline it uses.
Verify: The reference baseline is named in the findings. *Baselines evolve — verify against current Microsoft guidance.*
Implement: Use the documented baseline; note where organizational policy intentionally deviates.

## G7. Output handling and confidentiality
Description: A place to store the findings report and an understanding that it may contain sensitive posture detail.
Why: Assessment output is a roadmap of your weaknesses; it must be handled as sensitive.
Verify: A secure destination for the report exists; access is restricted.
Implement: Store findings securely; share on a need-to-know basis. *Risk-acceptance of any finding is the customer's decision.*

## G8. Remediation ownership (for the paired remediation)
Description: Named owners for acting on findings (the remediation is separate, pilot-first work).
Why: An assessment only creates value when someone owns closing the gaps.
Verify: Remediation owners are identified; the Remediation Playbook solution is available for the fixes.
Implement: Assign owners; use the Remediation Playbook (pilot-first, -WhatIf-gated) to close findings and re-score.
