# Global Requirements — Microsoft Teams Solutions

These requirements apply to **every** solution in the **Teams** category (Teams governance, meetings,
external access, Teams Phone, apps, Teams Rooms, and Teams security/compliance). Verify each before
starting a solution's implementation steps.

> **Vendor boundary (applies to every Teams solution).** The **Teams admin center**
> (admin.teams.microsoft.com), the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, the **MicrosoftTeams PowerShell
> module**, and **Microsoft Graph** are authored at exact, current click-by-click / cmdlet detail from
> Microsoft's public documentation. Where a capability, policy, or portal path is **plan- or
> version-dependent** (Teams Phone licensing, Calling Plans vs Operator Connect vs Direct Routing,
> Premium features, Commercial vs Government cloud), it is **cited or flagged "verify in your tenant"**
> — never invented. **Third-party devices and apps** (certified Teams Rooms hardware, SBCs, ISV apps)
> are integrated at the pattern level; their internals are deferred to the vendor's own docs. Automation
> is **PowerShell** (MicrosoftTeams module / Graph) — never with hardcoded credentials or secrets.

## 1. Microsoft 365 tenant with Microsoft Teams and appropriate licensing
- **Description:** A Microsoft 365 tenant with **Microsoft Teams** enabled and the licensing the
  capability requires (e.g. Teams Phone + a calling plan/Operator Connect for voice, Teams Premium for
  premium features, the appropriate E-plan for advanced compliance).
- **Why required:** All policy, voice, app, and compliance configuration depends on the right plan.
- **How to verify:** In the M365 admin center confirm the Teams subscription and relevant add-ons.
- **How to implement if missing:** Assign/purchase the required licensing before starting.

## 2. Administrative access (least-privilege Teams roles)
- **Description:** Access with the least-privilege role the solution names — typically **Teams
  Administrator** (or Teams Communications/Device Administrator), with **Global Administrator** only
  where genuinely required.
- **Why required:** Teams policy, voice, app, and org-wide settings require the corresponding role.
- **How to verify:** Confirm the role in the M365 admin center / Entra roles.
- **How to implement if missing:** Have a Global Admin assign the least-privilege role under change control.

## 3. Microsoft Teams PowerShell + Graph toolchain
- **Description:** A workstation with the **MicrosoftTeams** PowerShell module (and Graph PowerShell
  where used), modern-auth / MFA-capable admin sign-in.
- **Why required:** Configuration, automation, and the provided scripts run through Teams PowerShell / Graph.
- **How to verify:** `Connect-MicrosoftTeams` succeeds; `Get-Module MicrosoftTeams`.
- **How to implement if missing:** `Install-Module MicrosoftTeams`; confirm modern-auth sign-in.

## 4. Identity, groups & lifecycle source of truth
- **Description:** A defined identity/group source (Entra ID groups, and where used **Microsoft 365
  Groups** which back teams) and the **lifecycle** stance (creation, naming, expiration/retention) the
  org expects.
- **Why required:** Teams are backed by M365 Groups; governance, provisioning, and access key off
  groups and the lifecycle model.
- **How to verify:** Confirm which groups/OU model is authoritative and the lifecycle expectations.
- **How to implement if missing:** Define the group/lifecycle model before configuring governance.

## 5. A pilot scope and change control
- **Description:** A **pilot team / policy group / user set** to validate on before org-wide rollout,
  and a **change-control** process for production policy/voice/compliance changes.
- **Why required:** Every solution follows an **Assess → Design → Configure → Pilot → Validate → Expand**
  model; policy and voice changes are high-impact.
- **How to verify:** Confirm a named pilot scope and an approval/change window are available.
- **How to implement if missing:** Create a pilot scope and agree change control before production changes.

## 6. Security, compliance & governance stakeholders
- **Description:** Engagement with the **security, compliance/records, and collaboration-governance**
  stakeholders whose policies the configuration must satisfy (external access, information barriers,
  retention, DLP, app governance).
- **Why required:** Collaboration governance and compliance settings must align to enterprise policy.
- **How to verify:** Confirm the applicable policies and named approvers.
- **How to implement if missing:** Identify the owners and capture requirements before configuring governance.

*The deployment model across every Teams solution is the same: **Assess → Design → Configure → Pilot →
Validate → Expand**, with explicit pass/fail gates and a documented rollback for production changes.
Automation is delivered as **PowerShell** (MicrosoftTeams module / Graph) — never with hardcoded
credentials or secrets in code.*
