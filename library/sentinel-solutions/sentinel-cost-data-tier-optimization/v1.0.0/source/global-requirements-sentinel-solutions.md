# Global Requirements — Sentinel Solutions

These requirements are common to **every** Sentinel Solutions solution in the standard program model. They are the baseline Azure Monitor / Microsoft Sentinel platform prerequisites that any telemetry, detection, or SIEM engagement assumes. Each is structured **Description / Why / Verify / Implement-if-missing**. Solution-specific requirements (see `02-requirements.md`) are layered on top of these.

> Naming convention: every created object is named `<Purpose> - <Scope> - <Stage>` and reused verbatim throughout the engagement (for example `Audit Telemetry - Tenant - Pilot`).

---

## G1. An Azure subscription

- **Description:** An active Azure subscription in the tenant in scope, with billing enabled.
- **Why:** A Log Analytics workspace and Microsoft Sentinel are Azure resources billed against a subscription; nothing can be provisioned without one.
- **Verify:** Sign in to `https://portal.azure.com`, open `Subscriptions`, and confirm an active subscription resolves and shows status `Active`.
- **Implement-if-missing:** Create or associate an Azure subscription (Enterprise Agreement, CSP, or pay-as-you-go) and confirm billing is in place.

## G2. A Log Analytics workspace

- **Description:** A Log Analytics workspace to receive and store ingested telemetry, sized to the data volume and retention in scope.
- **Why:** Microsoft Sentinel runs on top of a Log Analytics workspace; all log data lands here and all queries/analytics run against it.
- **Why region matters:** the workspace region determines data residency and affects egress; pick one deliberately before ingestion starts (it cannot be moved later).
- **Verify:** `portal.azure.com` → `Log Analytics workspaces` → confirm the target workspace exists, note its region and resource group.
- **Implement-if-missing:** Create a workspace named `Security Telemetry - Tenant - Workspace`; choose the region for residency; select the pricing tier that fits expected daily ingestion.

## G3. Microsoft Sentinel enabled on the workspace

- **Description:** Microsoft Sentinel added to (enabled on) the Log Analytics workspace in scope.
- **Why:** Connectors, analytics rules, hunting, and incidents are Sentinel features layered on the workspace; without Sentinel enabled you have logs but no SIEM.
- **Verify:** `portal.azure.com` → `Microsoft Sentinel` → confirm the workspace is listed.
- **Implement-if-missing:** `Microsoft Sentinel` → `Create` → select the workspace → `Add`.

## G4. Administrative roles (least privilege)

- **Description:** Appropriately scoped roles for the work — Microsoft Sentinel Contributor (or Log Analytics Contributor) on the workspace for configuration, plus the tenant roles needed to set diagnostic settings on the sources (for example a role that can edit Entra ID diagnostic settings).
- **Why:** Each configuration action requires sufficient privilege; least-privilege scoping limits blast radius and satisfies audit requirements.
- **Verify:** On the workspace/resource group, `Access control (IAM)` → confirm the operating accounts hold the required roles. In Entra → `Roles & admins`, confirm the role that can edit diagnostic settings.
- **Implement-if-missing:** Assign the minimum roles needed at the resource-group or workspace scope; prefer eligible (PIM) activation over standing access where available.

## G5. Ingestion and retention cost plan

- **Description:** A documented estimate of daily ingestion (GB/day) and a retention decision (interactive retention vs long-term/archive), with a budget owner.
- **Why:** Sentinel and Log Analytics are billed primarily on data ingested and data retained; identity and device audit logs can be high-volume, so cost must be planned before connectors are switched on.
- **Verify:** Confirm a written estimate exists (sources × expected GB/day) and that retention periods are agreed per table or workspace.
- **Implement-if-missing:** Estimate volume from the source log categories in scope; choose pay-as-you-go or a commitment tier; set workspace/table retention; record the budget and owner.

## G6. Diagnostic settings capability on each source

- **Description:** The ability to create diagnostic settings (or enable the relevant data connector) on every source whose telemetry is in scope.
- **Why:** Telemetry only flows to the workspace when a diagnostic setting (or connector) routes the source's log categories to it; this is the switch that turns the pipeline on.
- **Verify:** For each source, confirm a diagnostic setting can be created and that no existing setting already routes the same categories elsewhere (to avoid duplicate ingestion and double billing).
- **Implement-if-missing:** Plan one named diagnostic setting per source that forwards the in-scope categories to the workspace (named per G's convention).

## G7. Change control & rollback posture

- **Description:** An approved change process with a scheduled window, plus a documented rollback (which diagnostic settings/connectors/analytics rules were added) before any change.
- **Why:** Enabling connectors and analytics rules changes ingestion volume (and therefore cost) and can generate incidents; controlled changes and a recorded back-out keep the pipeline safe and auditable.
- **Verify:** Confirm an approved change record and a written list of objects to be created (so they can be removed cleanly).
- **Implement-if-missing:** Stand up a lightweight change/approval process; capture the pre-change configuration; document the rollback (delete the named diagnostic setting / disable the connector / disable the rule).
