# Global Requirements — Asset Mgt (category-level)

These requirements apply to **every** solution in the **Asset Mgt** category (Software Asset
Management, license compliance, and entitlement governance). They are published once at the category
level so individual listings stay small. Confirm these before deploying *any* Asset Mgt solution.
Each entry: **Description · Why · Verify · Implement-if-missing.**

## G1. Microsoft Entra ID tenant
**Description:** An active Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) tenant.
**Why:** Identity is the backbone for user-based license assignment, access, and reporting.
**Verify:** Sign in to `https://entra.microsoft.com` as an administrator.
**Implement:** Create a Microsoft 365 / Azure subscription, which provisions a tenant.

## G2. Administrative access to the license sources
**Description:** Admin rights to the consoles that hold entitlements — at minimum the Microsoft 365
admin center (`https://admin.microsoft.com`), plus any others in scope (Adobe Admin Console,
publisher portals).
**Why:** Reading and adjusting entitlements, assignments, and true-ups requires elevated rights.
**Verify:** Each console loads and shows the licensing/billing area for an admin account.
**Implement:** Assign the least-privilege admin role per console (e.g. License Administrator or
Billing Administrator in Microsoft 365); reserve Global Administrator for tenant-wide changes.

## G3. A system of record for entitlements
**Description:** A maintained record of purchased entitlements, contracts, and renewal dates — a
SAM/ITAM tool, a ServiceNow/CMDB instance, or (at minimum) a controlled spreadsheet/repository.
**Why:** Compliance and optimization are only possible against a known, authoritative entitlement count.
**Verify:** You can locate the current entitlement quantity and renewal date for a representative product.
**Implement:** Stand up the records repository and import current purchase orders / true-up statements.

## G4. Deployment / usage discovery data
**Description:** A source of what is actually installed or used — Microsoft Intune, Configuration
Manager (SCCM), a discovery tool (e.g. Flexera), or sign-in/usage telemetry.
**Why:** Reconciling entitlements against real deployment/usage is the core of compliance and reharvesting.
**Verify:** You can export an installed-software or license-usage report for a sample of devices/users.
**Implement:** Enable Intune/Configuration Manager inventory or onboard a discovery tool; for SaaS,
enable usage/sign-in reporting.

## G5. Reporting toolchain
**Description:** Excel (PivotTables, Power Query) and/or Power BI for analysis and dashboards.
**Why:** License usage, compliance, and cost-optimization findings are delivered as reports/dashboards.
**Verify:** Power BI Desktop opens and can connect to a data source; Excel Power Query is available.
**Implement:** Install Power BI Desktop and a current Excel; provision a Power BI workspace if sharing.

## G6. Stakeholder and process alignment
**Description:** Named owners across IT, procurement, and finance, plus a request/intake channel
(e.g. ServiceNow) for license actions.
**Why:** Renewals, true-ups, and reharvesting require coordinated decisions and an auditable workflow.
**Verify:** A request can be raised and routed to the correct owner; procurement contacts are known.
**Implement:** Define roles (SAM analyst, approver, procurement liaison) and a documented intake process.

## G7. A pilot scope
**Description:** A representative subset (one product family, one department, or one publisher) to prove
the process before fleet-wide rollout.
**Why:** Every solution is piloted before broad adoption to validate accuracy and avoid disruption.
**Verify:** A pilot scope and its data owners are identified.
**Implement:** Choose a high-value, well-understood product/department as the first pass.

**The standard deployment model (all solutions):** **Assess → Configure → Pilot → Validate → Expand.**
