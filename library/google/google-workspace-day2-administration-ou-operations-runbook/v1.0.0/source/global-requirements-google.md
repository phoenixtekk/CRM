# Global Requirements — Google Workspace & Gemini Solutions

These requirements apply to **every** solution in the **Google** category. They are the common
foundation each Google Workspace / Gemini solution assumes is already in place (or stands up as part
of its own Requirements section). Verify each before starting a solution's implementation steps.

> **Vendor boundary (applies to every Google solution).** The **Google Admin console**
> (admin.google.com), **Google Cloud / Cloud Identity**, and the **Microsoft / Entra** sides are
> authored at exact, current click-by-click detail from the vendors' public documentation. **Gemini
> Enterprise** capabilities that are in preview or rolling out are **cited or flagged "verify in your
> tenant"** — never invented. **Third-party migration tools** (e.g. for mail/Drive/Chat data movement)
> and **third-party enterprise apps** (ServiceNow, SAP, Databricks, etc.) are integrated at the
> pattern/architectural level; their internal console steps are deferred to the vendor's own docs.

## 1. Google Workspace / Cloud Identity tenant
- **Description:** A provisioned Google Workspace (or Cloud Identity) tenant with a **super-admin**
  account for configuration, and the appropriate Workspace edition/licensing for the capability in
  scope (e.g. Enterprise Plus for Vault/CAA/DLP, Gemini/AI add-on where required).
- **Why required:** All configuration, policy, and API work is performed against this tenant.
- **How to verify:** Sign in to **admin.google.com** as a super-admin; confirm edition and license
  counts under **Billing / Subscriptions**.
- **How to implement if missing:** Provision the tenant and licenses through Google or an authorized
  reseller before starting.

## 2. Source Microsoft 365 / Entra environment (for migration & coexistence)
- **Description:** For migration/coexistence/identity solutions, administrative access to the source
  **Microsoft 365** tenant and **Microsoft Entra ID** (Global Administrator or the least-privilege
  roles the solution names).
- **Why required:** Migration, directory sync, SSO federation, and coexistence read from and change
  the Microsoft side.
- **How to verify:** Confirm access to the M365 admin center and the Entra admin center with the
  required role.
- **How to implement if missing:** Obtain the role from the M365/Entra tenant owner.

## 3. DNS control for the routed domains
- **Description:** Ability to create/modify **DNS records** (MX, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, TXT, CNAME) for the
  domains being migrated, coexisting, or verified.
- **Why required:** Domain verification, mail routing/coexistence, and authentication all depend on
  DNS changes.
- **How to verify:** Confirm access to the authoritative DNS zone for each domain.
- **How to implement if missing:** Coordinate with whoever controls DNS; stage changes under change
  control (mail-flow changes are high-impact).

## 4. Identity & provisioning source of truth
- **Description:** A defined **identity source of truth** (on-prem AD, Entra ID, or an HR/IGA system)
  and the sync mechanism (e.g. **Google Cloud Directory Sync (GCDS)** or SCIM-based provisioning).
- **Why required:** Consistent users/groups across ecosystems underpin SSO, licensing, and access.
- **How to verify:** Confirm which directory is authoritative and how objects flow into Google.
- **How to implement if missing:** Define the source of truth and provisioning model before configuring
  SSO or migrating.

## 5. A pilot scope (OU / group) and change control
- **Description:** A **pilot organizational unit or group** to validate on before fleet-wide rollout,
  and a **change-control** process for production changes (especially mail flow, DNS, identity, and DLP).
- **Why required:** Every solution follows an **Assess → Configure → Pilot → Validate → Expand** model;
  the pilot proves the design and change control protects production.
- **How to verify:** Confirm a named pilot OU/group exists and a change window/approval path is available.
- **How to implement if missing:** Create a pilot OU/group and agree the change-control process with the
  owners before making production changes.

## 6. Security, compliance & governance stakeholders
- **Description:** Engagement with the **security (CISO), legal/eDiscovery, and data-governance**
  stakeholders whose policies the configuration must satisfy (DLP, retention, Vault/Purview, and any
  regulatory regime such as ITAR/DFARS/Assured Controls where applicable).
- **Why required:** Data governance, eDiscovery, DLP, and regulated-workload settings must align to
  enterprise policy and legal requirements, not just technical defaults.
- **How to verify:** Confirm the applicable policies and named stakeholders/approvers.
- **How to implement if missing:** Identify the owners and obtain the policy/compliance requirements
  before configuring governance controls.

*The deployment model across every Google solution is the same: **Assess → Configure → Pilot →
Validate → Expand**, with explicit pass/fail gates and a documented rollback for production changes.*
